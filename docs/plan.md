# Plan

## Brainstorm

TODO: Come up with 2-3 possible games you might implement for this assignment. For each one, draw a diagram that shows an initial state and all possible moves for the first several turns of the game, given this initial state (`actions(s), result(s,a) for each action`) . Then, write a few sentences on how you might implement the game in Python. 

## Goals

TODO: Choose one of the games you brainstormed, and write a few sentences here about why you chose it. Then articulate three goals for your game. One goals should have to do with user experience, and one goal should have to do with writing an optimal search algorithm. The third goal can be anything you want. State your goals in a measurable way.

## Psuedocode

TOOD: Write out the steps for your program in pseudocode.
