# Goals

TODO: Copy your goals table from your **Art Planning** assignment here.

Feel free to revise your goals. Make sure that each goal has at least three yes-or-no questions that you can use to test whether the goal is met.

Goal tests can have some overlap, but each goal shouldn't have more than one overlapping test with other goals.
