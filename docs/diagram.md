# Diagram

TODO: Create a technical diagram of what you will build including pinouts and components. Use the [Arduino Nano RP2040 board](https://docs.arduino.cc/static/a4d65079ebe3058e37153eb0f93890a8/2f891/pinout.png) unless you've discussed another board with your professor. You can use design software in the computer lab to create this diagram if you would like.

Here are some diagram examples:
