# Reflection

TODO: Create a header for each of your goals (in `docs/goals.md`), and a bulleted list of each goal test.

For each goal test, write 50+ words about whether or not the goal was met, and what you learned in the process. What worked? What didn't? What could you do to improve moving forward?
