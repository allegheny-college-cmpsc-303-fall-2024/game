# Art Project

The art project is the first major project in this class! It's an opportunity to practice many of your IoT skills while getting creative.

The first thing you should do is add your goals from the [**Art Planning**](https://classroom.github.com/a/X9aQ_zHa) assignment to `docs/goals.md`. You can modify your goals as you see fit.

Remember, you earn credit for your goals by writing about them and documenting your progress. This is true **whether or not** you fully achieve each goal.

Open each document for detailed instructions on how to populate it.

The final deadline for all steps is March 4. Intermittent deadlines are as follows:
